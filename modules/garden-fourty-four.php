    <p>Across Nassau and Suffolk, Catholic Health offers adult and pediatric patients
access to the highest level of care for orthopedic conditions. We provide
the latest minimally invasive surgical procedures, as well as comprehensive
rehabilitation for injuries and post-surgical healing.</p>
    
    <p>To continue to serve our communities, we're looking to the future of orthopedic
care, in part by expanding access to ambulatory outpatient orthopedic
procedures. We now have surgery centers in communities such as East Hills,</p>
    
    <h3>The future is now: technological
advances in orthopedics</h3>
    
<p>Superior technology doesn't take away our doctors' human touch--they
make our care more accurate and precise, with better outcomes and faster
recoveries. The latest advances in orthopedics at Catholic Health:</p>

        <h4>Better robotics</h4>
        
        <p>Orthopedic surgeons use a guiding robotic arm during Mako partial knee resurfacing and Mako total hip replacement surgeries. This also allows surgeons to create a highly precise surgical plan with uploaded CT scans of the patient's joint</p>

      <care-card>
        <h4>Smarter
scanning</h4>
        
        <p>The Airo Mobile Intraoperative CT is an advanced scanning tool that gives our orthopedic surgeons greater ability to perform precise spine surgery. The portable, 32-slice scanner creates images that help surgeons make real-time decisions during surgery.</p>

        <h4>3D printing</h4>
        
        <p>Catholic Health shoulder specialists customize shoulder replacements using 3D printing technology. The process begins with CT scans of a patient's shoulder, which are uploaded into planning software. This allows physicians to map out exact angles to fit an implant for an individual's anatomy. Surgical guides are 3D printed so surgeons can align the implant perfectly.</p>

</h4>
    
    <p><span class="author">By Rev. Tadeusz Pacholczyk, PhD*</span></p>
    
    <p>There is a cultural tendency today to dismi
    those struggling with dementia as if they
    no longer persons. These patients, howe
    clearly deserve much more from us than t
    kind of benign neglect (or worse) that they:
    occasionally receive. Most of us probably
    fear ever getting a diagnosis of dementia for
    ourselves or for those we love. We worry about
    "surrendering our core" or "losing our true self
    to the disease.</p>

    <p>Steven Sabat, writing in The Journal of Clinic
    Ethics, comments: "Is his or her personhoo
    recognized and supported, or neglected in
    favor of the assumption that it barely, if at a
    exists..do we assume that the afflicted rarely
    if ever recognizes the need for company, for
    stimulation, for the same sort of treatment he
    or she would seek and be given as a matter of
    course in earlier, healthier, days?"</p>

    <p>The medical profession in particular faces a
    unique responsibility towards each individual
    with dementia, a duty to approach each life,
    especially in its most fragile (and uncooperative)
    moments, with compassion, patience and
    attention. When our ability to think rationally
    or choose freely becomes clouded or even
    eliminated by dementia, we still remain at root
    the kind of creature who is rational and free, and
    the bearer of inalienable human dignity.</p>

    <p>Those suffering from dementia challenge us
    in a particular way towards the beautiful, and
    at times heroic, response of love, "perceiving
    in the face of every person a call to encounter,
    dialogue and solidarity" (Pope John Paul II,
    "Evangelium Vitae").</p>
