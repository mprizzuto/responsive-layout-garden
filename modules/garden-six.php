    <p>Please stop using person-first language when talking about autism, it makes us feel like we shouldn't own a part of ourselves that we're proud of. I know autism doesn't define all of me,  I'm aware that there is more to me than my autism.</p>

    <p>But it is a part of me thast I love, just ike my creativity and honesty. ut we don't say "person with creativity" or "person with honesty" so why should my autism ve any different?</p>

    <p>Person first language is really less about interacting correctly with the autistic community and more about the fact that acknowledging disabilities makes YOU uncomfortable. But FYI disabled is NOT a bad word</p>
