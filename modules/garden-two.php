She was also the spokesmodel for Maybelline cosmetics from 2003 to 2009 and appeared in the company’s first calendar. She also did an ad-campaign for Swatch, which gave her additional recognition. Lima has appeared in several international editions of Vogue and Marie Claire. As a runway model, she has done the catwalks for designers like Giorgio Armani, Vera Wang and Valentino. Lima became a GUESS girl in 2000 and appeared in their fall ad campaign the very same year. In 2012, Lima earned the fourth position on the Forbes top-earning models list after she earned an estimated $7.3 million in one year.</p>
