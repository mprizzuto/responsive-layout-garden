    <p>In recent years, Brad Pitt's love life has been confined to being both Angelina Jolie's husband, or Angelina Jolie's ex-husband.</p>

    <p>But before he met his now-ex-wife on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith (prompting the now-infamous Jen Vs Ange-gate) Pitt's love life was vast and varied, even featuring a few familiar faces you've probably forgotten about.</p>

    <p>And during his active dating days, Pitt became well-known for dressing like his latest love interest. No, really.</p>
